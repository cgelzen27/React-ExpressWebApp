          <p>
            Happy Valentine's day and advance Happy 18th monthasary! ü•∞ I hope
            we can maintain this relationship forever kekek because I know
            you're the one for me üòò. It's only been a month and a half since
            we've seen each other but it already feels like eternity. I miss you
            so much!! I know we both have been busy lately, and it has been
            really hard to find some time to hangout. However, I appreciate you
            so much for always keeping me in the loop with your stories and
            chika! I want you to know that I really love listening to them even
            though sometimes I still fall asleep. I swear it's your soothing
            voice + my sleepiness üòÖüòÖ. Hmmmm Im running out of things to say
            kek, maybe because it's already 4:30 am here XD. Anw, I hope I'll
            get to see you again this year! so we can do more stuff together in
            real life. I also can't wait for u to get here! I will try my best
            for our future!! I hope ur ready soon too! because I really really
            want us to be together soon! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, I MISS YOU MWAMWA!
